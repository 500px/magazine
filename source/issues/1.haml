        Dear friend,
      %p.content_section_body
        Welcome to the first issue of Pixels. We often celebrate our work - the products, the releases, the metrics - but this magazine is not about any of those things. This magazine is about the people here. The wonderful people that we get the honour of working with each day, the individual pixels behind our shared mission.
      %p.content_section_body
        As our company grows, it may become more and more difficult to get to know all of our teammates as well as we'd like to. So this is my humble contribution to help keep us connected as we grow - across desks, across teams, across countries.
      %p.content_section_body
        So with that, I hope you enjoy some of the stories told in this issue, and get to know your friends at 500px a little better.
      %p.content_section_body
        Your friend,
      %p.content_section_body

        Lorena is the VP of Operations at 500px. She's a Colombian turned American turned Canadian, with two kids and a wonderful personality. If you've ever had a conversation with her, you know that she carries with her an awesome energy that inspires everyone that she interacts with.

        You grew up in Columbia. Can you tell me a little bit about your childhood?
      %p.content_section_body
        I had a really awesome childhood. I'm the middle child of an older brother and a younger sister. We were very close - well, my brother used to beat me up, but generally very close. I grew up in a really lucky household: two parents who loved each other, kids who got along well, big family. I loved dancing and eating lots of food.
      %p.content_section_body.bold
        When you were young, what did you want to be when you grew up?
      %p.content_section_body
        Originally, a doctor, and then I didn't do well in science so I decided that it was probably not the best path. Then I just wanted to be like my dad - he's an entrepreneur and I really admired him in how he led and managed people. He's my inspiration.
      %p.content_section_body.bold
        How do you think  growing up in Colombia affected your life?
      %p.content_section_body
        I grew up in Colombia in the 80s and 90s, which was a bit of a shitshow. Bombs were going off, so there was a lot of security at the time. There was a war between the guerrillas, the drug traffickers, the US government and the Colombian government, so I would say it helped me deal with chaos really well. I'm not really afraid of anything because I grew up in Bogotá.
      %p.content_section_body
        It also really made me proud. The media around the events in Colombia were so awful, and oftentimes totally exaggerated. So it made me even more protective of where I grew up, because not all Colombians were the way they were portrayed in the media. So now I fight for the people when others misspell Colombia. It gave me a big sense of pride for anything that matters to me. Family, friends, work.

      %p.content_section_body.bold
        You're very well educated - especially receiving your MBA from Harvard Business School. What were your college years like?
      %p.content_section_body
        Fun. I went to a small school in Boston called Babson College. I graduated with 300 students all of which studied finance, entrepreneurship, or some form of business. It was in Wellesley which was a dry town, so Babson - being very entrepreneurial - incorporated the town so we could have a pub. It was also a small school, very international, so I got to make friends from all over the world. My closest friends are Turkish and Greek. We danced a lot and partied a lot.
      %p.content_section_body.bold
        What are your thoughts on the post-secondary school system?
      %p.content_section_body
        I totally disagree with some people that say it's not important. Not so much for what you learn in the classroom - although depending on where you go it's also invaluable - it's just the people that you meet and what they teach you, the experiences they share with you that totally form who you are. Family to me is the people that I grew up with, but also the friends that I made both in undergrad and grad school, and I can't imagine not having those experiences to shape me. It's just so fundamental to who I am.
      %p.content_section_body.bold
        So you founded a company - MommiesFirst. Can you tell me about how that began?
      %p.content_section_body
        I studied entrepreneurship in undergrad, and like I mentioned, my dad is an entrepreneur. I always wanted to be like him, but I just never had an idea. Then my husband (Sandy) and I moved to Canada with a 3 month old. I was the most unprepared mother on the earth. I didn't even want kids until I met Sandy. I knew he'd be a really great dad, but I wasn't so sure about me as a mother.
      %img.content_section_image.pull.right(src="/images/issues/sep2015/lorena_3.jpg")
      %p.content_section_body
        Also, this was around the time that Birchbox had launched, and all the other monthly box services had been sprouting up. I thought, wouldn't it be great to do something like that for a pregnant mom-to-be or a new mom. I remembered feeling so unprepared, so it seemed really relevant because your baby and your body are changing month to month during pregnancy.
      %p.content_section_body
        So after my second son was born, I had a year long maternity leave - which is unheard of in the US - so I thought "what am I gonna do for a year?" Oh, I'll start a company. So I started it, and between the time we did the focus group and the time when we launched the website and started selling boxes was about 9 months. For me it felt really fast, and now when I look at 500px, it doesn't seem as fast.
      %blockquote.content_section_blockquote.pull.left
        "This was the first time that I realized that even if you work hard, it isn't necessarily going to translate into this huge success."
      %p.content_section_body
        Starting a company was the hardest thing I've ever done. Sandy always asks me if I would do it again, and I always say no. Starting a company is this awful and great combination of personal and professional. Here at 500px you can separate out your personal life, and there's not as much emotion, whereas when it's your business baby, the two are always intertwined, and you can never turn off.
      %p.content_section_body
        This sounds strange, but I have never failed in my life. And MommiesFirst was never something that would be a huge success. So from an ego perspective, that was tough. My attitude has always been if you put your head down and work hard, you will find success. This was the first time that I realized that even if you work hard, it isn't necessarily going to translate into this huge success.
      %p.content_section_body.bold
        How do you find work life balance, when you oversee operations at 500px but also have two kids and a husband at home?
      %p.content_section_body
        Work life balance is myth. But honestly, I have a really great husband. We met in school, so he's valued and appreciated my desire to make a difference in the world through work. He always tells me to define what's enough for the people at 500px and to define what's enough for the kids and the husband. He's just awesome.

      %p.content_section_body.bold
        If you could go back in time and tell your pre-children self something, what would it be?
      %p.content_section_body
        Get more sleep. Sleep now. My instinct is to say have fun, but I had a lot of fun. I wasn't young in having kids either, so I was selfish enough in my 20s that by the time I was ready to have kids, I was like okay. Let's do this. But yeah, get more sleep, for sure.
      %p.content_section_body.bold
        Why did you decide to join 500px?
      %p.content_section_body
        Janice, Andy, Sandy and I moved to Toronto at the same time, so we met relatively soon after arriving in this cold world. We became friends, so I came to Andy at 500px and said "Hey, I'm selling MommiesFirst. I really want to stay in the startup world but at a place that's more established. Do you know of companies in your network that might be looking for someone like me?" That was on Thursday, and by Monday I was in the office.
      %p.content_section_body
        It was a very unexpected journey. At the start, I came because of Andy, because I believed in his leadership, his work ethic, and what he was trying to do. And I was chatting with him recently and I said "I'm no longer here because of you - I'm here because I really respect and admire the team."
      %blockquote.content_section_blockquote.fit
        "I love coming to work every day. I love the challenges, but more importantly I respect what everybody brings to the table and what they're teaching me."
      %p.content_section_body
        So that's a long way of saying that I'm here because of the people. I love coming to work every day. I love the challenges, but more importantly I respect what everybody brings to the table and what they're teaching me.

        How do you like living in Canada, and what do you miss about living in the US?
      %p.content_section_body
        It's so cold. So this can't be shared with Sandy, but I do really like living here. I love New York - we left New York to come here - so it's the city in my heart, but I wouldn't want to raise two kids there. Canada's a good place to live. I do miss the shopping. It sounds so superficial, but it's just not the same here.
      %p.content_section_body.bold
        What's a goal in life that drives you today?
      %p.content_section_body
        A lot of people know Harvard Business School as a business school, and I think rightfully or wrongfully so, it's developed a reputation. But its motto is to develop leaders that will make an impact on the world, and I believe that every student fundamentally believes that going into the school.
      %p.content_section_body
        I don't think I've done that quite yet. I've had professional success, but I don't think I've made a difference in the world. At some point I'd like to be a part of an organization at a leadership level that is not just making money, but is making life better for people, and is giving people a voice that don't necessarily have one.
